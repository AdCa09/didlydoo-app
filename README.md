# Didlydoo
<p>Didlydoo is a web app that allows you to create and manage events with your friends. With all the duties and challenges of modern life, it's becoming harder to spend time with friends, each having their own obligations. Didlydoo allows you to create an event of your choice, add several possible dates, and display your availability (or lack thereof) for each date. Once all of your friends have input their own availabilities, the table display allows you to easily select the best date for your event.</p>
